Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements both exercises as described in the chapter content. It generates random sentences from a file and manipulates a JSON string, adding a new key and saving it to a file. All steps are followed correctly.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with meaningful variable names and clear function definitions.
- performance: The code is efficient for the given tasks. The file reading and JSON parsing are standard operations and do not introduce any performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code does not have any obvious security vulnerabilities. It handles file reading and JSON parsing safely.
