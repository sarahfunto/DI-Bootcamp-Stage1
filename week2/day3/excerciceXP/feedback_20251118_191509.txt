suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the `__repr__` method can be simplified to directly return the string representation from `__str__`, avoiding redundancy.
- In Exercise 2, even though there is a correct call for the add_numbers function, there is a piece of code that is commented, so the code has been executed but is not clean
- In Exercise 4, the date is formatted but the initial date is also printed, just print the good format.
Correctness: 100%
