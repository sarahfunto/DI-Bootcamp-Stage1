Reducing Genetic Counseling Wait Times with Data Analysis

1. What is the problem
A large health system faced a problem: they had a shortage of genetic counselors and a growing number of referrals. This caused very long wait times for patients. To solve this, they partnered with a company called Genome Medical. Through this partnership, they delivered genetic counseling using a hybrid model (in-person + telemedicine). This allowed them to drastically reduce wait times and scale their counseling services in USA.

2. Role of Data Analysis
Data analysis was central to this solution:
They collected and analyzed referral data, patient backlog, and staffing levels to understand how many people were waiting and why.
By analyzing these data, they could model different approaches ( more telehealth, more counselors) and project how wait times would respond.
The most important question to validate this teleconsultation model is to have data on the number of patients who have undergone a genetic counseling consultation over a given time, which has allowed them to validate the effectiveness of the new hybrid model.

3. Impact
Without data analysis, it would have been impossible for them to realize how long the waiting times were or to see how to reduce these delays as effectively as possible.
The goal is to improve access to genetic counseling to prevent personal and family missed opportunities, as these consultations are both a source of information to optimize patient care and to prevent risks within families.
