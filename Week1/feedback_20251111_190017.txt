suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 1, the code manually creates the dictionary. Consider using the `zip` function as suggested in the instructions for a more dynamic solution.
- In Exercise 2, the code correctly calculates and prints the ticket prices. Consider adding the bonus feature to allow user input for family member details.
- In Exercise 3, the code correctly manipulates the dictionary. However, there is no inclusion of `more_on_zara` dictionary merge.
- In Exercise 4, the code manually creates the dictionaries. Use loops and other methods to fulfill instructions.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code addresses all four exercises outlined in the chapter content. Exercise 1 could improve its use of `zip`. Exercise 2 is complete except bonus. Exercise 3 did not include `more_on_zara` section. Exercise 4 can improve with using loops.
- readability: The code is well-formatted and easy to understand.
- performance: The code demonstrates reasonably efficient practices for the tasks involved.
- security: The code doesn't involve any user input in a production setting and is not vulnerable to common exploits.
