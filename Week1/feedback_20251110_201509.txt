suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more descriptive variable names for enhanced readability, especially in the second exercise.
- Add comments to explain the logic behind each section of the code.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately solves both problems outlined in the 'Chapter Content/Questions'. Challenge 1 correctly generates a list of multiples, and Challenge 2 effectively removes consecutive duplicate letters from a string. Both solutions adhere to all instructions and examples provided.
- readability: The code is generally readable due to its straightforward structure and use of meaningful variable names (e.g., 'number', 'length', 'multiples').  However, adding comments could further enhance understanding. Exercise 2 can benefit from better variable names.
- performance: The code demonstrates good performance, utilizing simple loops and string manipulation techniques. The algorithms have linear time complexity, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
- security: The code is reasonably secure. The use of `int(input())` provides basic input validation for numerical inputs. However, consider adding more robust error handling (e.g., using try-except blocks) to handle invalid input formats.
